In this submission, we have Database API where the namespaces db and db::parser need to be included in the compilation file of interest, .a file that serves as the library, test case documentation, and group documentation.  The .a file is the MacOS version of the static library.  This can be run with the following command line "g++ file_of_interest.cpp static_lib.a."  If you have any questions, comments or concerns, we are ready to help.  --Team 23.
